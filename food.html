        <P>
            As you all fans know, I was born in a garage.
            I was ment to be a garage cat. Garage cat food is bad.
            My previous owners didn’t care much about cat nutrition.
            If they had something they didn't want they just gave it to me and my mother.
            Dinner leftover and cheap dry food.  Thankfully my awsome mother taught me how
            to hunt mice.
            Catching mice was the main reason we were welcome to live in the dirty garage.
            Luckily I was saved from this destiny. My new owners are more than caring.
            In the beginning they gave me kitten food from the supermarket.
            But then suddenly Geir came home with a big bag of dry food from the vet.
            Vet kitten nutrition food. Yammy! And some times they give me cat candy.
            I just love my owners ❤ Cat milk! Cat candy!

            One time Geir tricked me to eat too much.
            I guess he wants me to match him more than Lise.
            In that case I have a hard job to do.
            He put cat candy in the bottom of my bowl,
            and normal food on top.
            I had almost never tasted cat candy before and got completely crazy.
            I ate everything until I reached the bottom.
            Lise was horrified finding my puke on the floor,
            thinking I was gone sick. Well, I sniffed on it,
            it smelled good, and I ate it again. Puke is ok.
