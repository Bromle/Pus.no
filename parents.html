        <h3>
            My parents
        </h3>
        <P>
            My mother gave birth to me in a garage. It was a cold wintermorning.
            When our current owners became aware of me we were moved into the house
            because my mothers last kids were taken by a fox. When i was a few months old
            our owners were going away for almoust a week.  They locked a room off from
            the rest of the house and left a window open so my mom could get in and out as she
            pleased. we had a lot of food but my mother wanted me to start eating mice.
            So she went out and killed some mice for me, alot of mice.
            When our owners came back from their journey we had 10-12 half eaten mice
            in the washing room of the house. They screamed becouse there were blood everywhere.

            I have never seen my father but in the picture you can see how i imagine him.
            He's probably big, wild and spends his life surviving in the wild.
        </P>
