        <h3>
            Outside
        </h3>
        <P>
            Outside my house is alot of green grass and a small forest.
            I usually go into the forest to hunt for mice and small birds.
            If it's cold i usually go into my box in the garage.
            My box has a nice warm blanket were i can stay warm.
            unfortunately i live in an area densely populated by
            humans, so there are very few mice to catch.
            I try to catch birds but they usually fly high up
            in the sky so i can't get to them. Lise has a small garden
            with some plants she likes to eat. I like to shit in the box were
            she grows them. The dirt there is perfect to dig in.
        </P>
